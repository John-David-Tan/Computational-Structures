50.002 introduces the architecture of digital systems, emphasising structural principles common to a wide range of technologies. In specific, the course develops:

A hierarchical set of building blocks that make up a digital system (logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite state machines, processors, and complete systems)
Understanding of the operation of a moderately complex digital system; a simple RISC-based computer we called the Î²
Using the building blocks above, and ability to specify, implement and debug its components.
Exploration of both hardware and software mechanisms through a series of design examples (labs and 1D/2DC projects)

This course equipped me with the following skills:

Familiar with flaws and limitations in simple systems using the static discipline, clocked registers and async inputs.
Implement a simple RISC-based CPU architecture
Apply architectural support and tackle instruction set design issues for contemporary software structures.
Analyse of potential concurrency, precedence constraints, and performance measures.
